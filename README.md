### Mahalo! ğŸ‘‹

<**NeoMeta-Modernist/NeoMeta-Modernist** This is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because, as its `README.md` (this file) explains:

Herein is a multifaceted project that brings together a number of my somewhat disparate interests-- in the form of a scarily cognizant and entirely conversational-
repository of knowledge. The level of specialization and the degree of expertise will be remarkable. But those aspects will be of secondary importance. What will
make my Neuro-Convergent app significant, will be how personable He seems. His specific expertise is Jungian psychoanalysis, which is a vast miasma of comparative
religion, film trivia, numerology, Art History, And Feminism. Most importantly, users will choose to keep interacting with my 'Humane Encyclopedia' similarly to 
how human beings have interacted with digital entities 'Tetris'; 'Ms. Pac-Man'; & 'Mario' & 'Luigi' since time immemorial.-

Of Charlie Kauffman's notable ouevre, "Her"-- while exceptionally well done, has always been my least favorite, just beacause it's essentially an affirmation of 
what Ira Levin predicted in his follow up to Rosemary's Baby- The Stepford Wives,(Levin, Ira. The Stepford Wives. First Perennial edition. New York: Perennial, September, 1972) albeit a less paranoiac mind bender; and tries to have a more nuanced portrayal of the misogynistic fantasy...
And the trope of the Sentient AI who is, not just a more innately skillful-& efficient Killing Machine than any of us puny humans-- 
But a sentient AI who is better than most of us at being humane, and that we grow by interacting with.

**NeoMeta-Modernist/NeoMeta-Modernist** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md`is (this file).
