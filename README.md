### Mahalo! ğŸ‘‹

<**NeoMeta-Modernist/NeoMeta-Modernist** This is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because, as its `README.md` (this file) explains:

Herein is a multifaceted project that brings together a number of my somewhat disparate interests-- in the form of a scarily cognizant and entirely conversational-
repository of knowledge. The level of specialization and the degree of expertise will be remarkable. But those aspects will be of secondary importance. What will
make my Neuro-Convergent app significant, will be how personable He seems. His specific expertise is Jungian psychoanalysis, which is a vast miasma of comparative
religion, film trivia, numerology, Art History, And Feminism. Most importantly, users will choose to keep interacting with my 'Humane Encyclopedia' similarly to 
how human beings have interacted with digital entities 'Tetris'; 'Ms. Pac-Man'; & 'Mario' & 'Luigi' since time immemorial.-

Of Charlie Kauffman's notable ouevre, "Her"-- while exceptionally well done, has always been my least favorite, just beacause it's essentially an affirmation of 
what Ira Levin predicted in his follow up to Rosemary's Baby- The Stepford Wives, albeit one set in a less paranoiac distopia; and tries to have a more 
ironically self-aware--intellectualized portrayal of the misogynistic fantasy...

And the trope of the Sentient AI who is, not just a more innately skillful-& efficient Killing Machine than any of us puny humans-- 
But a sentient AI who is better than most of us at being humane, and that we grow by interacting with--goes as far back as Matt Leblanc, As Joey Tribianni-
serendipitously being cast opposite a humourous cyborg police officer on the show "Mac & Cheese"-- the "show within the show" "F*R*I*E*N*D*S".

Nevertheless, and without mentioning the significance of Alex Garland's or Paul Verhoeven's commentaries on the Rise of the Machines... And to say nothing of
Hamilton's "Just What is it that Makes Today's Dream Homes So Different... So Appealing?" and without fawning as equally over Independent Group as over Andy Warhol; nor qualifying my Love for Warhol by noting that I can also understand where Valerie Solonas was coming from... 
Nevertheless, although Scarlett Johannson's character (in "Her") spelled it out for developers, as yet
No One, that I know of, has succeeded at making an engaging artificial consiousness. Though-since the pandemic, When Big tech spent all that time scrutinizing
our consumerist habits- Ai now veritibly knows more and has more power than we do... as yet We haven'tsuccessfully Made any more compelling personalities than
Spotify or Ask Geeves.

**NeoMeta-Modernist/NeoMeta-Modernist** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md`is (this file).
